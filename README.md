## ✨ Project Description

**Magick&Spell** is a simple PHP-based guestbook web application themed around my friend's enchanting local perfume business. This interactive platform allows users to sign a guestbook by sharing their name, favorite scent variant, preferred size, quantity, and a personal message.  

The perfumes are infused with symbolic meanings and magical appeal—blending scent and storytelling. The app calculates the total cost and stores each submission in a text file while displaying previous entries in a stylish layout. A special message also appears based on the selected variant.
